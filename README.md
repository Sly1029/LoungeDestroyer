LoungeDestroyer
==============

A must have Chrome extension for any CS:GOLounge / Dota2Lounge user.

## Installation
##### Stable, non-development

Visit Chrome App store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loungedestroyer/ghahcnmfjfckcedfajbhekgknjdplfcl) and just add it to your Chrome extensions.

##### Developer version, cutting edge

1. Download the project by clicking 'Download ZIP' on repository home page and extract the contents in some folder, or just clone the repository with `git clone`
2. (optional) Make your desired changes to the code
3. Open your browser and navigate to chrome://extensions/
4. Enable 'Developer mode'
5. Press 'Load unpacked extension' and select the folder where you extracted the contents of the project in step

Keep in mind that this way the extension won't auto update it self, you will have to pull the changes yourself manually if you want the newest stuff.

## Bugs
If you find any bugs, make sure you have read [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/loungedestroyer/wiki/index) and then submit it to the Issues page. We also offer rewards to those who have found serious security issues within the extension if you disclose before it has been too late.

## Updates
It is possible that CSGOLounge.com might update their site which breaks LoungeDestroyer's functionality. Chrome provides auto-updating functionality, but you can trigger the updates from Extensions page in Chrome settings. From your browser in address bar, navigate to chrome://extensions/, enable 'Developer mode' and press 'Update extensions' now.
